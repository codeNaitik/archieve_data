I have much pleasure in writing a Foreword to a valuable and
interesting study on Jain perspective of religion written by Dr Aurbind
Sharma Though we have many studies on Jain Religion by famous
scholars, Dr Sharma's approach to Jain Religion has surpassed the
earlier studies The Jam Perspective of Religion by Dr Sharma is quite
different in approach from the other concepts of religious subjects
based on rational or revealed theology As Jainism does not believe
in the existence of Creator-god, rational theology for the existence
of God does not have any place in it So also is the case with
revealed theology which "deals with those truths which are acces-
sible to human beings only through thin revelation by God The
others' approach to religious studies based on natural theology or
apologetics is quite alien to the system of Jain religion Dr Sharma
did not discuss the subject from the point of view of natural
theology which "was to demonstrate rationally the existence of
God, thus preparing the way for the claims of revelation "
Apologetics refers to the "philosophical defence of religious be-
hefs" "It must, however, be distinguished from Jain philosophy,"
says Dr Sharma, "just as apologetics itself must be carefully dis-
tinguished from the philosophy of religion" To all intent and
purposes, Dr Sharma discusses the problem in a lucid way from
a new angle of vision

Thus the basic point to contend with is that "All things (vastu)
thus possess an infinite number of qualities (anantadharmatmakam vastu),
each of which can only be affirmed in a particular sense. Such an ordinary
thing as a jug will be found to be the object of an infinite number
of affirmations and the possessor of an infinite number of qualities
from infinite points of view, which are all true in certain restricted
senses and not absolutely" The situation is further complicated
by the fact that the assertions can be positive as well as negauve
This opens another can "Thus in the positive relation riches cannot
be affirmed of poverty but in the negative relation such an
affirmation is possible as when we say 'the poor man has no riches'
The poor man possesses riches not in a positive but in a negative
way Thus in some relation or other anything may be affirmed of
any other thing, and again in other relations the very same thing
cannot be affirmed of it The different standpoint from which things
(though possessed of infinite determinations) can be spoken of as possessing
this or that quality or as appearing in relation to this or that, are technically
called naya"?

There is no doubt that this constitutes a morally imaginative
understanding of the doctrine of karma and reincarnation How-
ever, from a Jaina point of view, it runs into two difficulues The
first of these is that such an understanding assumes a doctrine in
which karma works itself out 'corporately' rather than individually
The Jaina understanding of the working of karma, however, is
highly individualistic, even more so than in its Hindu and Buddhist
versions The second difficulty in accepting a demythologized in-
terpretation of the Vedantic doctrine of karma and reincarnation
lies in the fact that it is possible to offer a demythologized inter-
pretation of the Jaina doctrine of karma and reincarnation itself
The Jaina emphasis on a highly individualistic understanding
of this karma has already been alluded to This individualism
explains why the Jainas did not adopt the Hindu custom of śräddha,
in which the son makes offerings to nourish the departed-because
it implied that one individual's karma (the son's) could somehow
influence someone else's (1e the father's) state of well-being
According to the Jaina view, only one's own actions could influence
one's destiny" The following lines of a tenth century Jaina teacher,
Amitagati, may also be cited in support of this position They
almost celebrate the fact of karmic indivisibility
